            <h2>About the Developer</h2>
            <p>My name is Samar Elshamey </p>
            <p>I am currently a student in the ALX Software Engineering program, where I've been studying Software Engineering Fundamentals for nine months now.</p>
            <p>During this time, I have gained valuable skills in programming languages such as C, Python and Java, as well as proficiency in web development technologies like HTML5, CSS, and frameworks like Flask.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about creating efficient and user-friendly applications. I am excited to share my journey and contribute to the development community through projects like this cake blog.</p>
            <p>For me, creating this cake blog is more than just a school projectâ€”it's an opportunity to share my love for baking and technology with the world.</p>
            <p>This project is part of my Portfolio for Holberton School. You can find more details on my GitHub account</p>
